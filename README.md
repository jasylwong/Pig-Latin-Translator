#Pig Latin translator#

A translator to help you translate English into Pig Latin!

Assumptions:

- Input may consist of alphabetic characters only (A-Z, a-z, numbers and spaces)
- All punctuation, numerals, symbols and whitespace are not modified


Features I am in the process of adding:

- Hyphenated words are treated as two words
- Punctuation marks - multiple sentences

A translator to help you translate English into Pig Latin!

Assumptions:

- Input may consist of alphabetic characters only (A-Z, a-z, numbers and spaces)

Features I am in the process of adding:

- Punctuation marks - multiple sentences
- Hyphenated words are treated as two words
- All punctuation, numerals, symbols and whitespace are not modified

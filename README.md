# Pig Latin translator #

Ellohay! This is a translator I have created to help you translate English into Pig Latin.

Please see this link for what Pig Latin is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin

## How to use this programme

1. Clone the repo to your local directory:
`git clone https://github.com/jasylwong/Pig-Latin-translator.git`

2. Run the programme in command line:
`$ruby pig_latin_translator.rb`

## Assumptions: ##

- Input may consist of any alphabetic characters only (A-Z, a-z, numbers and spaces)
- All punctuation, numerals, symbols and whitespace are not modified


 ## Features I am in the process of adding: ##

- Hyphenated words are treated as two words
- Punctuation marks - multiple sentences

# Pig Latin translator #

Ellohay! This is a translator I have created to help you translate English into Pig Latin.

What is Pig Latin? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin

## Getting started

`git clone path-to-your-repo`
`command_to_install_dependencies` (e.g. `bundle`)

## Assumptions: ##

- Input may consist of alphabetic characters only (A-Z, a-z, numbers and spaces)
- All punctuation, numerals, symbols and whitespace are not modified


 ## Features I am in the process of adding: ##

- Hyphenated words are treated as two words
- Punctuation marks - multiple sentences
